      # *** Change this when you want to change the name of the pipeline resources
      # Note that this is account aware, so you can safely deploy the same repo
      # to multiple accounts (bucket names are globally unique), but you don't have to do this.
      # With the way this setup works you MUST end the bucket name with -${AWS::Region}, so that
      # the buckets can be found by the pipeline template
